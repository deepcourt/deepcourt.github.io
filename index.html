    <section id="about">
        <p>
            I've been on the ground floor of scaling businesses. I helped manage growth at Deliveroo during its 600% revenue surge and was a founding team member of REEF UK, scaling its kitchen network from <b>2 to over 100 locations in 20 months</b> as revenues grew <b>920% YoY</b>. I've also evaluated hundreds of business models as a VC.

            Now, I use that experience to help businesses fix operational leaks and build efficient engines for growth. I do this through consulting and by building targeted B2B Saas software like <a href="https://deliverybyte.com/" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>.
            <!-- I'm a self-taught Python developer and B2B Saas founder specializing in AI-powered automations. I bootstrapped <a href="https://deliverybyte.com/" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a> (saving restaurants $1,700+/mo via LLM workflows), and now I'm bringing custom AI solutions to a wider range of SMBs and startups. Formerly scaled Reef Technology UK from 2 to 100+ dark kitchens and led early-stage VC deals at SFC Capital (selected <a href="https://delightful-spoonbill-436.notion.site/VC-Deal-Sheet-by-Carmelo-Spano-8a598ebc175c49c1a328785d442e9c2f" target="_blank">VC deals</a> I led/contributed to).<p> -->

        <h3>How I can help</h3>
        <p>My consulting work is focused on creating tangible financial and operational results. I offer services in three core areas:</p>

        <b>(1) Food delivery & last-mile logistics optimisation</b>
        <p>The delivery market is defined by razor-thin margins. I help multi-location restaurants, QSRs, independent restaurant brands, and last-mile logistics firms protect their profit and expand effectively.</p>
        <p><b>-What I do:</b> I perform a deep analysis of your delivery channel performance and unit economics. I also review and help renegotiate your <b>commercial partnership terms</b> with delivery apps (Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Just Eat, DoorDash, etc) and suppliers to improve your margins.</p>
        <p><b>-The result:</b> A clear, data-driven plan to increase profitability per order and secure more favourable commercial agreements.</p>


        <b>(2) AI & Process Automation for SMEs</b>
        <p>For businesses generating £2M-£20M ($2.7M-$27m) a year, manual processes are a silent growth killer. I design and implement custom automation solutions to eliminate these bottlenecks. Much like when I built an automated CRM workflow at Deliveroo that <b>acquired 120+ leads a day with zero marketing spend</b>.</p>
        <p><b>-What I do:</b> I analyse your current finance and operational workflows, identify the most costly manual tasks, and build lightweight automation tools to handle them.</p>
        <p><b>-The result:</b> Thousands of pounds/dollars saved in labour costs and hundreds of hours returned to your team to focus on high-value work.</p>

        <b>(3) Growth & Operations for Series A+ Startups</b>
        <p>Post-Series A, the challenge is building a scalable organisation. Having managed deals and <b>negotiated term sheets</b> from the VC side, I help leadership navigate this phase with an investor's perspective.</p>
        <p><b>-What I do:</b> I work with your team on market expansion strategy, financial modelling, building performance dashboards, and <b>structuring commercial partnerships</b>. I help prepare you for future funding rounds by ensuring your operational metrics and narrative are sound.</p>
        <p><b>-The result:</b> A more resilient, efficient organisation that grows faster and negotiates from a position of strength with partners and investors.</p>

        <h3>Experience & results</h3>
        <p><b>-Reef Technology:</b> As a founding team member of the UK business, I was instrumental in scaling the network from <b>2 to 100+ locations in 20 months</b>, supporting <b>920% YoY revenue growth</b>. I launched major brands like Wendy's and MrBeast Burger and negotiated commercial and legal terms with national chains.</p>
        <p><b>-Deliveroo:</b> As part of the new market launch team, I developed an automated lead-generation workflow that acquired <b>over 120 rider leads per day across 20+ cities without a marketing budget</b>, fuelling the operational capacity for hyper-growth.</p>
        <p><b>-SFC Capital, fka Startup Funding Club:</b> As an Investment Manager, I participated in rounds for companies like <b>Axiom AI (YC-backed)</b> and led a <b>£1m ($1.34m) round for Mayku alongside notable investors</b>. I also sourced and closed the largest single LP investment in the fund's history, <b>doubling the previous record</b>. [View a selection of led/contributed deals] (coming soon)</p>

        <h3>Abut me</h3>

        <p>I am a founder and a builder. I created <a href="https://deliverybyte.com" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>, an AI-powered tool that automatically recovers incorrect refunds for restaurants, saving them over £1,300 ($1,760) a month.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, you can usually find me on a tennis court competing in local tournaments.</p>

        <h3>Get in touch</h3>
        <p>I typically work with businesses that have a specific, costly operational problem they need to solve. If this sounds like you, I would be glad to discuss it.</p>
