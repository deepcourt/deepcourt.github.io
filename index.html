            <p>
                I've been on the ground floor of scaling businesses. I helped manage growth at Deliveroo during its 600% revenue surge and was a founding team member of REEF UK, scaling its kitchen network from <strong>2 to over 100 locations in 20 months</strong> as revenues grew <strong>920% YoY</strong>. I've also evaluated hundreds of business models as a VC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I use that experience to help businesses fix operational leaks and build efficient engines for growth. I do this through hands-on consulting and by building targeted B2B SaaS software like <a href="https://deliverybyte.com/" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>.

            <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
            <p>My consulting work is focused on creating tangible financial and operational results. I offer services in three core areas:</p>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(1) Food Delivery & Logistics Optimisation</h3>
                <p>The delivery market is defined by razor-thin margins. I help multi-location restaurants, QSRs, and last-mile logistics firms protect their profit and expand effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I perform a deep analysis of your delivery channel performance and unit economics. I also review and help renegotiate your commercial partnership terms with delivery apps and suppliers to improve your margins.</p>
                <p><strong>The result:</strong> A clear, data-driven plan to increase profitability per order and secure more favourable commercial agreements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(2) AI & Process Automation for SMEs</h3>
                <p>For businesses generating £2M-£20M ($2.7M-$27M) a year, manual processes are a silent growth killer. Much like when I built an automated CRM workflow at Deliveroo that <strong>acquired 120+ leads a day with zero marketing spend</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I analyse your current finance and operational workflows, identify the most costly manual tasks, and build lightweight automation tools to handle them.</p>
                <p><strong>The result:</strong> Thousands of pounds saved in labour costs and hundreds of hours returned to your team to focus on high-value work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(3) Growth & Operations for Series A+ Startups</h3>
                <p>Post-Series A, the challenge is building a scalable organisation. Having managed deals and <strong>negotiated term sheets</strong> from the VC side, I help leadership navigate this phase with an investor's perspective.</p>
                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I work with your team on market expansion strategy, financial modelling, building performance dashboards, and structuring commercial partnerships.</p>
                <p><strong>The result:</strong> A more resilient, efficient organisation that grows faster and negotiates from a position of strength with partners and investors.</p>
            </div>
