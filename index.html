                I've been on the ground floor of scaling businesses. I helped manage growth at Deliveroo during its 600% revenue growth, as Uber announced Uber Eats, and was a founding team member of Reef Technology UK, scaling its delivery-only kitchen network from <strong>2 to over 100 locations in 20 months</strong> as revenues grew <strong>920% YoY</strong>. I've also evaluated hundreds of business models as an early-stage, sector agnostic, VC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I use that experience to help businesses fix operational leaks and build systems that create predictable growth. I do this through consulting and by building profitable B2B SaaS software like <a href="https://deliverybyte.com/" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>.

            <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
            <p>I focus on three areas where I can deliver a return on your investment.</p>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(I.) For Food Delivery & Last-Mile Logistics Operators</h3>
                <p>You're operating on thin margins in a large, competitive market. Every percentage point matters. I help you optimise your delivery channel performance. I help multi-location restaurants, QSRs, and last-mile logistics firms protect their profit and expand to new markets.</p>
                <p><strong>Service:</strong> In-app promotional and ads strategy, menu and store-front optimisation, revenue and customer performance analysis, and troubleshooting operational leaks. I also review and help renegotiate your commercial partnership terms with delivery apps and partners to improve your margins.</p>
                <p><strong>Past Example:</strong> At Wingstop, we identified that one of the best-selling item was misaligned with their core branding, leading to a simple but powerful shift in operational focus which led to a decrease in delivery service fees.</p>
                <p><strong>The result:</strong> A clear, data-driven plan to increase profitability and secure more favourable commercial agreements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(II.) For SMEs (£2M-£20M/$2.7M-$27M Revenue) with Manual Processes</h3>
                <p>Your team is wasting hours on repetitive, manual, boring tasks. They are a silent growth killer, it slows you down and costs you money. I design and build custom AI-powered workflows to automate these processes.</p>
                <p><strong>Service:</strong> I'll analyse your current operations, identify the most impactful automation opportunities, and build a custom solution (typically in Python) to handle tasks like data entry, report generation, dynamic dashboards, customer support triage, market monitoring, or invoice processing.</p>
                <p><strong>My Own Proof:</strong> I built <a href="https://deliverybyte.com" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>, a SaaS that uses AI to automatically analyse refunds from delivery apps and recover over £1,300 ($1,760) a month for restaurant clients like Going Greek and Que Ricos Fresh Mexican Kitchen.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Thousands of pounds/dollars saved in labour costs and hundreds of hours returned to your team to focus on high-value work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>(III.) For VC-Backed Startups (Series A+) Needing to Scale</h3>
                <p>You have product-market fit and funding, but your operations are under the pressure of growth. You need scalable systems, yesterday. Having managed deals and <strong>negotiated term sheets</strong> from the VC side, I help leadership navigate this phase with an investor's perspective.</p>
                <p><strong>Service:</strong> I act as an interim Head of Growth, Ops, or Revenue Operations. I come in to build the dashboards, define the KPIs, and implement the processes you need to scale from 10 to 100 people without everything catching fire.</p>
                <p><strong>Past Experience:</strong> I was on the ground during Deliveroo's 600%+ hyper-growth phase, scaling the UK's rider fleet. At Reef Technology, I helped scale the UK kitchen network from 2 to over 100 sites, launching global brands like Wendy's and MrBeast Burgers.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> You get a more resilient, efficient organisation that grows faster and negotiates from a position of strength with partners and investors.</p>

                <h3>Deliveroo</h3>

I also sourced and closed the largest single LP investment in the fund's history, <strong>doubling the previous record</strong>.</p>

        <section id="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My career has been an ongoing obsession with one question: what makes a company built to last actually work? I started at <b>Deliveroo</b>, learning how to build and scale operations from the ground up during a period of explosive growth.</p>
            <p>I then moved into Venture Capital at <b>SFC Capital</b>, where I analysed hundreds of business models a year. I saw firsthand why most startups fail and what the winners do differently. I learned to spot operational weaknesses and opportunities from an investor's perspective.</p>
            <p>At <b>Reef Technology</b>, I combined those skills, taking on a senior commercial role where I negotiated deals with major brands (like Island Poké, Coco di Mama, GBK, MrBeast Burgers, Wendy's and many more), modelled expansion plans for multi-million dollar investments, and managed the operational performance of our delivery kitchen network.</p>
            <p>Today, I run my own profitable B2B SaaS app, <a href="https://deliverybyte.com" target="_blank">DeliveryByte</a>, and use my experience to help other businesses grow.</p>
